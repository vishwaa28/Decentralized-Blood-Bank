# Blood Bank Management System

## Overview
The Blood Bank Management System is a decentralized application built using Python that leverages blockchain technology to securely manage blood donations and requests. The system allows users to register as donors, patients, and admins, facilitating efficient blood donation and request management while ensuring data integrity and transparency.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register as donors, patients, or admins, storing their details securely in the blockchain.
- **Blood Donation Records**: Donors can add their blood donation records, which are stored immutably in the blockchain.
- **View Records**: Users can view all blood donation records and registered users.
- **Blood Request System**: Patients can request blood based on their required blood type, with the system searching for matching donations.
- **Data Integrity**: All records are secured using cryptographic hashing, ensuring that they cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Transparency**: The system provides a clear audit trail of all transactions, building trust among users.
